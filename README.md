# Virtual Sound Sculptures
Mobile Application

_Virtual Sound Sculptures_ is a music art gallery in a virtual space. The artworks presented in this art gallery are musical sculptures, pieces of _Vertical Music_. A piece of _Vertical Music_ develops in time as a sculpture: that is no development. But like every sculpture, and in general every artwork in a gallery, its development is created by the observers. They decide a path of points to observe, composing their own time experience of a static object. In this work, space is a virtual space wrapping the artworks, defining the boundaries of the time experience. The virtual space is inscribed in the Earth coordinates system, therefore it would embrace the entire globe. It is defined only in the acoustical dimension, visual clues are not present.

This work is presented in a mobile application through which the user accesses the virtual space. Every artwork of the music gallery is limited in space and restricted to a specific region. Its position is defined by several coordinate points (three to a maximum of ten). The audience in the art gallery, e.g. the user of the mobile application, can listen to the artworks only within those specific boundaries. Similarly to the experience of a physical art gallery, the observers can move around, get away from, or close to each artwork. They can listen to different layers of the musical sculpture, moving between the coordinate points in which the sculpture is defined. A group of artworks occupies a larger space, defining a trajectory through a city, a park, and so on, like an art gallery defining a path of artworks inside the hosting structure. 

The application is based on two essential elements: the audience (mobile app users) and the sound sculpture, while the core of the mobile application is the system of interaction between them. The audience explores the virtual sound space through a pair of headphones. Thanks to a position tracking system every user is described by a couple of coordinates and a direction in the virtual space. Each artwork consists of several sounds, layers of a musical sculpture distributed in the virtual space (with as many as the coordinates point by which is described). Then, the application provides a 3D audio system with which the user can do a complete 360-degrees experience.

The application is realized with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). The audio core is realized with _Web Audio API_.
